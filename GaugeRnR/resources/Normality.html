If we don't have enough data the it might not be normal distributed. We can test if the data is normal distributed using a Shapiro-Wilk Test. Small values of W are evidence of departure from normality. It is important that our parts are normally distributed. A P-value smaller then 0.05 indicates that the data is not Gaussian.</p>
