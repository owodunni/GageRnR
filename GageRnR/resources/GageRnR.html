<p style = "font-family:Segoe UI,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:16px;">Gauge R&amp;R, which stands for gage repeatability and reproducibility, is a statistical tool that measures the amount of variation in the measurement system arising from the measurement device and the people taking the measurement. </p>

<p style = "font-family:Segoe UI,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:16px;">Unfortunately, all measurement data contains a certain percentage of variation. The variation is the difference between the true values and the observed values. The variation represents the amount of measurement error. In addition to measurement error, is the actual product or process variation. When we combine measurement error with product or process variation the resulting value represents the total variation. To assure that our measurement data is accurate we must determine if the amount of variation is acceptable</p>

<p style = "font-family:Segoe UI,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:16px;">If the p value is less than 0.05, it means that the source of variation has a significant impact on the results.</p>
